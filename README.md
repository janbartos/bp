# Search and analysis of variables pertinent to TFR
The aim of this thesis is to analyze the fertility rate and its dependence on various trends in Internet or literature searches. Google Trends and Google Ngram are used to analyze the trends. In this thesis, I examine the keywords that I have compiled based on factors that have already been identified by the literature and those that have not been identified as likely by the literature. Each keyword is placed in a category that will be monitored with more attention. The analysis includes an application written in Python using the Streamlit library, which makes it an application that can be accessed on the Internet. The result of the work is an interactive and publicly accessible application that shows the evolution of fertility rates over time in different countries of the world with similarities to internet and literature searches with statistics that can help the user to discover if keyword searches are in relation to fertility rates.
